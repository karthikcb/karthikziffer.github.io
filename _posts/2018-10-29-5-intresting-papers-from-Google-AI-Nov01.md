   1. [One Model To Learn Them All](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub46203)
   This paper demonstrates a single model to solve problems spanning from multiple domains. This model is trained on ImageNet , COCO dataset , a speech recognition corpus, and an English parsing task.
   2. [Fluid Annotation](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/10/fluid-annotation-exploratory-machine.html)
   A tool for image annotation. This is a model which performs a strong semantic segmentation, which a human annotator can modify through machine assisted edit operation. Fluid Annotation is a first exploratory step towards making image annotation faster and easier.
   3. [A Neural Representation of Sketch Drawings](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub46008)
    In this paper, a sketch rnn is presented. A recurrent neural network able to construct stroke based drawings of common objects. The team has outlined a framework for conditional and unconditional sketch generation, and describe new robust training methods for generating coherent sketch drawings in a vector format.
   4. [Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45826)
   In this paper, the team used a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set.
   5. [Adversarial Spheres](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub46623)
   This paper is a study of misclassification images by the network which is close to correctly classified images. This is a study to solve the above mentioned adversarial perturbations of the input.
