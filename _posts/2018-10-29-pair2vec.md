<!-- > Reasoning about implied relationships (e.g. **paraphrastic**, **common sense**, **encyclopedic**) between pairs of words is crucial for many cross-sentence inference problems.

This paper proposes new methods for learning and using embeddings of word pairs that implicitly
represent background knowledge about such relationships.



###### Pointwise mutual information:

$$
pmi(x , y) = log \frac {P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)}
$$
